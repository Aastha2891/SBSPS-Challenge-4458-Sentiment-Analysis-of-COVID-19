# SBSPS-Challenge-4458-Sentiment-Analysis-of-COVID-19

Our aim is to develop a sentiment analysis visualization dashboard. The Corona Virus has put the entire world at a standstill and governments all around the world are employing various methods to keep the situation under control. At this point, analyzing the sentiments and emotions of people can help provide an insight into how a particular decision will influence the public. The situation also poses a threat to the mental health of an individual, understanding how the public reacts to a decision can be further used to help people overcome anxiety and stress. 

We extracted the tweets from Twitter with the help of Tweepy. The tweets are preprocessed using a combination of preprocessing techniques and labelled with the help of IBM Watson Tone Analyzer. We deploy a Google BERT model for fine tuning. All the evaluated metrics will be displayed on the dashboard using DASH framework.

All the code will be uploaded as the task is completed.
